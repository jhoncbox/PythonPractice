## practice, getting the radius of a circle
radius = 20
area = radius * radius * 3.14159
print("the area of the circle of radius ",radius," is ", area)

##Reading the input from the console
##variable = input("enter a string: ")

## compute the first area
radius = 1.0
area = radius * radius * 3.14159
print("the area of the circle of radius ",radius," is ", area)

## compute the Second area
radius = 2.0
area = radius * radius * 3.14159
print("the area of the circle of radius ",radius," is ", area)

# causing an overflow
245.0 ** 1000
