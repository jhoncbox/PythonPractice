# Write a brief description of all the following Object Types and Data Structures we've learned about:

# Numbers: number types in python are int, float and complex.

# Strings: are conjuction of characters.

# Lists: list is a data structure in Python that is a MUTABLE or changable order of elements!!
#        Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. lists use squeare brakets

# Tuples: Tuples are likes Lists, with the difference that these are IMMUTABLE. once a tuple is create
#            it cannot change. Tuples uses parentheses.

# Dictionaries: is an unordered collection of items. While other compound data types have only value as an element,
#               a dictionary has a key: value pair. Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known.

##Write an equation that uses multiplication, 
##division, an exponent, addition, and subtraction that is equal to 100.25.

print(10e2*10/5-1950+50.25)

# Answer these 3 questions without typing code. Then type code to check your answer.

# What is the value of the expression 4 * (6 + 5)
# R = 44
# What is the value of the expression 4 * 6 + 5 
# R = 29
# What is the value of the expression 4 + 6 * 5
# R = 34

print(4 * (6 + 5))
print(4 * 6 + 5)
print(4 + 6 * 5)
